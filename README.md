# Calculator-App-using-Procedural-and-Object-Oriented-Approches
Calculator app build using both procedural approach and object oriented approaches in Python

The first folder explains a simple command-line calculator script that performs basic arithmetic operations using a procedural approach. It lists supported operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division), provides instructions for running the script, and describes the functions used (add, sub, mul, div, and cal). It notes that the script includes error handling for division by zero, welcomes contributions, and states that the project is licensed under the MIT License.

The second folder explains a similar calculator program implemented using an object-oriented approach in Python. It describes the My_Calculator class and its methods (__init__, add, sub, mul, div, and cal). The README provides instructions for running the script and interacting with the calculator, highlights error handling for division by zero, invites contributions, and states that the project is licensed under the MIT License. It also includes an example section demonstrating how the class and its methods work together.
